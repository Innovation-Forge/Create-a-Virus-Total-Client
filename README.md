# Create-a-Virus-Total-Client
This script calculates the MD5 hash of files in a specified directory and checks their status using the VirusTotal API. It outputs the VirusTotal report for each file to a text file. The script uses the os and hashlib libraries for file handling and hashing, and the virus_total_apis library for interacting with the VirusTotal API.
